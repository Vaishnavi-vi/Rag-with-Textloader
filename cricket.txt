Title: Comprehensive Report on Cricket: A Global Pastime

I. Introduction

Cricket is a bat-and-ball game, reputed to be the second most popular sport in the world, after football (FIFA). It is played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players. The game is believed to have originated in southeast England during the 16th century and has since developed into a sport played globally, particularly in Commonwealth countries such as India, Pakistan, Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, England, and the West Indies.

II. Gameplay and Rules

A. Teams and Players

1. Each team consists of eleven players, with a captain leading each side.
2. Two umpires are present on the field to ensure that the game adheres to the rules.

B. Equipment

1. A flat pitch (22 yards/20.12 meters long) is prepared for the match.
2. A bat, made of willow wood, is used by the batsmen to score runs.
3. A ball, made of cork, wrapped in leather, is used to get batsmen out.
4. Wickets, made up of three stumps and two bails, are placed at both ends of the pitch.
5. Protective gear, such as pads, gloves, helmets, thigh guards, arm guards, and abdominal guards, are worn by the batsmen for protection.

C. Scoring

1. Runs are scored when a batsman hits the ball with his bat and runs to the opposite end of the pitch, with his partner also making it to the crease before the fielding team can return the ball and dislodge the bails.
2. Runs can also be accumulated through penalties awarded against the fielding team (e.g., wide balls, no-balls).
3. Batsmen can also hit the ball out of the playing field for boundaries (four runs for hitting the ball along the ground, six runs for hitting the ball directly over the boundary without it bouncing).

D. Dismissals

1. A batsman can be dismissed through various methods, including:
a. Bowled - When the ball hits the stumps, dislodging the bail(s).
b. Caught - When the batsman hits the ball in the air and a fielder catches it before it touches the ground.
c. Leg Before Wicket (LBW) - When the ball would have hit the stumps if the batsman hadn't used his leg or body to obstruct it.
d. Run Out - When the fielding team manages to dislodge the bails before the batsman completes a run.
e. Stumped - When the wicket-keeper dismisses the batsman by dislodging the bail(s) after the batsman has left his crease and the bowler has control of the ball.
f. Various other rare dismissals, such as Hit Wicket, Hit the Ball Twice, or Obstructing the Field.
